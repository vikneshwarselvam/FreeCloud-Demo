# FreeCloud
Freecloud is a opensource alternative to cloud services which allows users to share their resources with others and utilize other's resources, it is like a barter system for computational resources

# Example
A user with a powerful GPU can share his GPU with others looking to train their ML Model and earn credits and can use those credits when he needs a CPU to compile some large codebase into binary
